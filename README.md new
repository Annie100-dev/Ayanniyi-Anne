# Telco Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project analyzes churn behavior in a telecom company and builds predictive models to help reduce customer attrition. The dataset includes demographic, account, and service usage data for over 7,000 customers.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source:** IBM Sample Telco Customer Churn dataset
- **Rows:** ~7,000 customers
- **Columns:** 21 features
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes/No)

## ðŸ§  Modeling Approach
We trained and evaluated the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Insights & Recommendations

### Key Findings
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-month customers are most likely to churn.
- **Tenure:** Churn decreases significantly after the first year.
- **Paperless Billing:** Associated with higher churn.
- **Internet Service:** Fiber optic users have higher churn risk.
- **Senior Citizens:** Slightly elevated churn rates.

### Recommendations
1. **Encourage long-term contracts** with discounts and perks.
2. **Focus onboarding efforts** during the first 3 months.
3. **Targeted retention offers** for fiber optic and paperless billing customers.
4. **Deploy churn prediction scoring** in production.
5. **Continuously monitor satisfaction** via surveys and outreach.

Results
Best model achieved:

Accuracy ~80%

ROC-AUC ~0.85
